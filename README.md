| K     | N   | J   | R   |  -   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| b     | q   | t   | h    |  -   |
| `0` | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |


| Q     | D   | R   | H   |   -  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| f     | d   | m   | h    |   -  |
| 0 | 1   | `2`   | 3   | 4   |


| E   | Q   | D   | k     |  -   |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | --- |
| e   | y   | d   | k     |   -  |
| 0   | 1   | 2   | `3` | 4   |

| f   | d   | m   | h   |  -   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F   | D   | R   | H   |   -  |
| 0   | 1   | 2   | `3`   | 4   |

### Task 3 : Number Speed & Accuracy

This task measures speed and accuracy in carrying out number tasks in your head. For each question presented start by finding the highest and lowest of the three numbers displayed.
Having identified those, decide whether the highest number or the lowest number is numerically further away from the remaining number.

Example 1: 4, 2, 8
the answer is `8` *because 8 - 4 = 4 while 4-2 = 2 so 8 is further away from 4 than the 2*

Example 2: 12, 3, 5
answer is `12`

Example 3: 10, 7, 5
answer is `10`

Example 4: 11, 13, 16
the answer is `16`

### Task 4 : Word Meaning

This is a task to see how quickly you can spot the **odd word** out in a group. You will be given three words. Two of the three will be related in some way, and the third is the odd one out. Each time decide which word is the odd one out and click it.

Example 1; halt, cold, stop
answer: cold

Example 2: up, down, street
